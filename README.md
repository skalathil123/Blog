    <h1 class="blue">Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>
      Hey - my name is Sherin, welcome to my corner of the Digital World! I want
      to learn more software languages over the summer, as I already know the
      basics of JavaScript, HTML and a little bit of CSS. Using this blog, I
      want to spread awareness about different issues going on in the world, as
      well as chart my own personal growth.
    </p>
    <p class="green bold">Here are some fun facts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>My favourite colours are blue and red</li>
      <li>
        I am currently trying to become more proficient in the Trachtenberg Math
        Models, developed by Jakow Trachtenberg to escape the horrors that came
        with being forced into a Nazi Concentration Camp.
      </li>
      <li class="bold">Black.Lives.Matter.</li>
      <li>
        113 countries do not have laws to ensure equal pay for equal work among
        men and women (Source:

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="red bold">Also, my favourite books include...</p>

    <ul class="slanted">
      <li>The Kite Runner</li>
      <li>The Fault in our Stars</li>
      <li>Pie</li>
      <li>Ikigai</li>
      <li>Merchant of Venice</li>
      <li>Lord of the Flies</li>
      <li>Changing The Way You think To Fulfil Your Potential</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ultimately, my hope is that you will stick around to learn new things with
      me - Sherin :)
